Guided Search:
	Suggested Implementation :
		- backend already gets the filters when we hit the listing api , so they can send the next set of guided filters ( or some way to directly use inline filters response ) and currently applied filters [ maintaining our filter object structure consistency ] in the same api in same key
		- so when user selects one of the guided filters and we hit the listing api , the whole process can repeat [ key point to extract filters from listing api response only , coz there is some logic to merge make model filters ]

	Questions :
		- till which level should the guided filters work , like for example , if user has selected two or three guided filters , will a 4th set of guided filter appear ? coz anyways it would not be visible on screen 


Post BI Education screen:
	Suggested Implementation :
		- take the experiment Key from backend , rest all will be done by fronetend only
		- for the `view similar cars` cta in the education screen , we have the filters stored in redux


Similar cars on listing ( https://cars24.atlassian.net/browse/CTWM-6435 )
	Suggested Implementation :
		- i think , this will be purely backend task
