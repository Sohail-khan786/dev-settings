Tracking things after release :




Extra Efforts ( for appraisals ):
    - c2b api improvements results of Msite and Desktop 
    - b2c my-booking page api improvement results and  my-booking pages pagination of Msite and Desktop 
    - Continuous efforts to improve web-vials of Msite and Desktop 
    - Timely review of PRs and early identification of bugs
    - lowest bug count in the team : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hjPeodjv9LhnRWJ8pIMlyCTX_bTrkrveRgPonSumZu8/edit#gid=2054517210
    - UAE : base setup [ most error prone part ] for the reducer splitting code 
    - UAE : resolved long running prod-bug in TDS flow apart from my sprint work [ user landing on slot selection page even after selecting the slot - TDS flow ]
    - Didn't create a fuss over not  getting the thailand lead position , even though i was the more suitable candidate and trusted the leadership decision and proved myself in the second geography [ team-player ]
    - UAE : made the imageUrl generation code and coupon component more user-friendly [ card clickability ], across whole website without extra ticket for it , along with sprint work [ initiate and ability to deliver ]
    - Commitment and loyalty : Commitment ( first appraisal was 1.5 years later , which was never considered ) and loyalty to the company is very high , been working for 2+ years and was never short on my delivery and always made extra efforts to improve the codebase [ even without any recognitition happening in the geography ]
    - SSR  api calls optimization [ also proper template and KT to team for use ] , to improve our webvitals across msite and website [ extra effort apart from sprint work ] : https://bitbucket.org/cars24/consumer-web-ae/pull-requests/7094
    ----------------- NEW -----------------
    - UAE : resolved long running prod-bug in which the listing scroll postion of the user is lost whenever he goes to detail-page of car and comes back [ giving very bad user experience  ]. Resovled this apart from sprint work , identified it myself and fixed it myself, apart from my usual sprint work without creating a ticket and inform QA head of this case to be added to regression suite.
    - UAE : worked on weekened to fix the INP issue , when the situation demanded it
    - extra work : do a POC on react-window for UAE repo




    - recommended cars is newly added section , need to add min-height on it 


Docker Command :
    - Docker QA build Comand : docker build -t consumer-web-th -f Dockerfile-gcp .


Run test on individual file :
    - yarn tests src/client/utils/post-booking/__tests__/post-booking.test.js


Practices to Adopt :
    - sentry error logs reading 
    - daily PR review [ perferably before DSM or end of day types ]
    - stack PR review method 
    - deploying UI with testing data [ but don't move tickets to ready for QA ] -> to help check UI in different devices from office 
    - reading react tech blogs
    - daily use this resource for historic web-vital data tracking for any url : https://auditzy.com/features/core-web-vital-checker/report
    - maintaining web-vital lab data screenshot for before and after any release : to fix any issue that is spotted post release
    - check INP and all on RUM vision tool


Learn :
    - read up on frontend system design 
    - react render proper pattern : read from patterns.dev
    - PWA ( progressive web app ) with service worker
    - https://www.patterns.dev/posts/render-props-pattern
    - read up on webpack in more depth 
    - read up on gatsby in more depth
    - do a POC on google-pub-sub event driven micro-services
    - complex design pattern spring boot
    - how our current project differentiates between mobile device and desktop device
    - webpack and micro-frontend course : https://www.udemy.com/course/webpack-5-ninja-build-micro-frontend-and-web-apps/

Web Performance Optimization techniques : 
    - For App Ticket : always make sure  of backward compatibility
    - take care of FCP , LCP and CLS web vitals , as they are very important for google Ranking 
    - coverage tab in chrome : https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/
    - squoosh.com for reducing image sizes
    - preload and pre-connect images
    - use this resource for historic web-vital data tracking for any url : https://auditzy.com/features/core-web-vital-checker/report
    - webpack graph reading and optimizationx
    - width , quality and dpr paramter for CDN images to download them in minified sizes 
    - cost of import : dynamic import of high cost helper functions or components which are conditionally used , they can be made as dynamic import 
    - try to read cookie data on SSR, and according to that , you can load the control or Variant component according to that 
    - try to call dynamic data / api-call on SSR for better SEO results
    - animations and popups should be avoided in first fold
    - bundleAnalyser : uncomment BundleAnalyzerPlugin ( "webpack-bundle-analyzer" ) 2 lines and yarn build the project ( "BundleAnalyzerPlugin" )

-------- PERSONS TO CONTACT ---------

DSM:
    - 


Retro Points :
    - DSM to be run epic/story wise , instead of individual person wise
    - calender invites for release calls are not getting scheduled properly , some of the team members do not get invite.
    - Kudos to Sohail, Sukhpal and Harish , for being available to resolve all doubts related to subscription and quick resolution to ensure a smooth release


UAE code base optimizations to pick:
    - reducer Splitting : already in progress
    - make all SSR api calls paralled if they are non-dependent : already in progress
    - login token expires quickly : recheck the refresh token mechanism : to-do
    - DOM elements are very big in size , especially for listing size : to-do
    - MobileEvents and Desktop events chunking/splitting : to-do
    - Back log Bugs [ pick section wise every sprint ] : to-do
    - check this for Async loading of third party scripts : https://partytown.builder.io/how-does-partytown-work




Prashant :
        - Ask to extend Notice period by one week if you will get one week money




    
-------------- PAGE optimization rules ------------------

PAGE optimization rules:
    - the page should have no warnings or erros 
    - the images and containers should have height width to improve cls
    - components not visible in first fold should be in loadable with fallback div which has the component height as inline css
    - the loadables should be wrapped inside reactLazyLoad component
    - make all popups as loadable
    - recheck page with different SEO tools [ pagespeed extension , core-web-vital extension and lighthouse extension ]
    - check the sizes of the images getting loaded and all
    - see the all the SEO links are working properly 

-------------- Release optimization rules ------------------

Release optimization rules:
    - monitor for sentry error 
    - monitor core-web vitals of important pages like home page , listing , cdp , etc
    - review team PRs thoroughly
    - stack PR method


-------------- Runnning Website on Mobile ------------------



NOTE : that your mobile device and laptop should be connected to same wifi

1. Get you wifi IPv4 address from system-preferences -> network
2. run this commond in your terminal -> export HOST=IPv4  ->  export HOST=172.16.5.248
3. Run the website
4. now on mobile , type IPv4:3000/page-url
5. once mobile debugging is done, close the current terminal 
6. now to again run websites on your desktops , just open new terminal and work as normal
