Tracking things after release :




Extra Efforts ( for appraisals ):
    - c2b api improvements results of Msite and Desktop 
    - b2c my-booking page api improvement results and  my-booking pages pagination of Msite and Desktop 
    - Continuous efforts to improve web-vials of Msite and Desktop 
    - Timely review of PRs and early identification of bugs
    - lowest bug count in the team : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hjPeodjv9LhnRWJ8pIMlyCTX_bTrkrveRgPonSumZu8/edit#gid=2054517210
    - UAE : base setup [ most error prone part ] for the reducer splitting code 
    - UAE : resolved long running prod-bug in TDS flow apart from my sprint work [ user landing on slot selection page even after selecting the slot - TDS flow ]
    - Didn't create a fuss over not  getting the thailand lead position , even though i was the more suitable candidate and trusted the leadership decision and proved myself in the second geography [ team-player ]
    - UAE : made the imageUrl generation code and coupon component more user-friendly [ card clickability ], across whole website without extra ticket for it , along with sprint work [ initiate and ability to deliver ]
    - Commitment and loyalty : Commitment ( first appraisal was 1.5 years later , which was never considered ) and loyalty to the company is very high , been working for 2+ years and was never short on my delivery and always made extra efforts to improve the codebase [ even without any recognitition happening in the geography ]
    - SSR  api calls optimization [ also proper template and KT to team for use ] , to improve our webvitals across msite and website [ extra effort apart from sprint work ] : https://bitbucket.org/cars24/consumer-web-ae/pull-requests/7094
    ----------------- NEW -----------------
    - UAE : resolved long running prod-bug in which the listing scroll postion of the user is lost whenever he goes to detail-page of car and comes back [ giving very bad user experience  ]. Resovled this apart from sprint work , identified it myself and fixed it myself, apart from my usual sprint work without creating a ticket and inform QA head of this case to be added to regression suite.
    - UAE : worked on weekened to fix the INP issue , when the situation demanded it
    - extra work : do a POC on react-window for UAE repo




    - recommended cars is newly added section , need to add min-height on it 


Docker Command :
    - Docker QA build Comand : docker build -t consumer-web-th -f Dockerfile-gcp .


Run test on individual file :
    - yarn tests src/client/utils/post-booking/__tests__/post-booking.test.js


Practices to Adopt :
    - sentry error logs reading 
    - daily PR review [ perferably before DSM or end of day types ]
    - stack PR review method 
    - deploying UI with testing data [ but don't move tickets to ready for QA ] -> to help check UI in different devices from office 
    - reading react tech blogs
    - daily use this resource for historic web-vital data tracking for any url : https://auditzy.com/features/core-web-vital-checker/report
    - maintaining web-vital lab data screenshot for before and after any release : to fix any issue that is spotted post release
    - check INP and all on RUM vision tool


Learn :
    - read up on frontend system design 
    - react render proper pattern : read from patterns.dev
    - PWA ( progressive web app ) with service worker
    - https://www.patterns.dev/posts/render-props-pattern
    - read up on webpack in more depth 
    - read up on gatsby in more depth
    - do a POC on google-pub-sub event driven micro-services
    - complex design pattern spring boot
    - how our current project differentiates between mobile device and desktop device
    - webpack and micro-frontend course : https://www.udemy.com/course/webpack-5-ninja-build-micro-frontend-and-web-apps/
    - how auto-suggestion works in india : https://cars24.slack.com/archives/G5GD6T5PZ/p1684304316882299
    

Web Performance Optimization techniques : 
    - take care of FCP , LCP and CLS web vitals , as they are very important for google Ranking 
    - coverage tab in chrome : https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/
    - squoosh.com for reducing image sizes
    - preload and pre-connect images
    - use this resource for historic web-vital data tracking for any url : https://auditzy.com/features/core-web-vital-checker/report
    - webpack graph reading and optimizationx
    - width , quality and dpr paramter for CDN images to download them in minified sizes 
    - cost of import : dynamic import of high cost helper functions or components which are conditionally used , they can be made as dynamic import 
    - try to read cookie data on SSR, and according to that , you can load the control or Variant component according to that 
    - try to call dynamic data / api-call on SSR for better SEO results
    - animations and popups should be avoided in first fold
    - bundleAnalyser : uncomment BundleAnalyzerPlugin ( "webpack-bundle-analyzer" ) 2 lines and yarn build the project ( "BundleAnalyzerPlugin" )

-------- PERSONS TO CONTACT ---------

DSM:
    - 


Retro Points :
    - Need test numbers in QA env also , else cases where 3-4 user are required becomes really tough : ( reported in retro-sprint-72 )
    - the listing service goes down often on QA and stage , it requires running some cron/api-call , this should happen automatically in QA and stage. Hampers the testing experience and created a dependency


UAE code base optimizations to pick:
    - reducer Splitting : already in progress
    - make all SSR api calls paralled if they are non-dependent : already in progress
    - login token expires quickly : recheck the refresh token mechanism : to-do
    - DOM elements are very big in size , especially for listing size : to-do
    - MobileEvents and Desktop events chunking/splitting : to-do
    - Back log Bugs [ pick section wise every sprint ] : to-do
    - check this for Async loading of third party scripts : https://partytown.builder.io/how-does-partytown-work


Sohail :
    - VIRTUAL_TD :
            - check entire msite flow against figma , as isMRL check in the codebase can break many things
            - check entire desktop flow against figma , as isMRL check in the codebase can break many things
            - check entire hub booking flow as well
            - check entire home booking flow as well
            - check if add car to TD works fine or not in Msite - Need to verify how it works first, BE driven just send bookingType properly , check and confirm with arjun and sukhpal
            - check if add car to TD works fine or not in Desktop - Need to verify how it works first,  BE driven just send bookingType properly , check and confirm with arjun and sukhpal
            - refactor the new code base added to accomodate for future introductions of booking type, and each booking type will have its own configuration, use git diff to properly refactor your changes

        GOOD TO HAVE VIRTUAL_TD :
            - add animations to the the test drive option accordian
        TEST DATA :
            - http://localhost:5000/buy-used-chevrolet-trax-2019-cars-dubai-9714806787?from=listingPage
