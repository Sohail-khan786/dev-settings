Appoorv:
    - thai and english designs properly for each map location flow ? -> given
    - what if user first inputs a servicable location and that drags it to a non-servicable location, what is the expected behaviour here ? -> verified with apoorv -> he will also add this to figma for QA testing purposes
    - GA events are missing i guess  -> to  be given 
    - I don't see any button to close the additional-home-info popup screen -> system back -> search address popup should open
    - what does the arrow button do ? does it open google maps in new tab for something ? [ highlighted the button in the screenshot below ] -> recenter to existing position from where user started dragging the pin
    - which popup opens on Edit button click -> search address popup should open
    - the google API should not be called upon save and continue click -> talked to sambhav -> its wrong product flow -> verified with appoorv
    - if user drops from additional-home-info-popup and comes back for continuing the booking -> it will be prefilled with the address that searched on google maps
   

ruchi :
    - desktop checkbox only appearing after clicking them


Sambhav :  
    - and the extra listing starts after reserved cars -> raise it to product

Maggi:
    - bookingType has different meaning in frontend , i guess in backend also , to be it in sync , it should be deliveryMode
    - string for deliveryMode is different in frontend eg : hub is PICK_UP
    - sort the 401 error that you are getting while creation of new endpoint
